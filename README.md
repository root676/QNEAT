# QNEAT

The QNEAT (short for Qgis Network Analysis Tool) Plugin aims to provide sophisticated QGIS Processing-Toolbox algorithms
in the Field of Network Analysis. In order to assure usability and consitency in the QGIS software design, the QNEAT-Plugin
is not designed as a simple GUI extension but as a downloadable extension of the toolbox algorithms. Further information will
be provided at the corresponding [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Design-of-advanced-network-analysis-algorithms-for-the-QGIS-processing-library) project-website.

###Currently planned algorithms
- Simple Path (Dijkstra) between coordinates
- Shortest Path (Dijkstra) between two points in layers
- Isochrone Area calculation with advanced interpolation techniques
- Origin-Destination Matrix between all points of a layer.

At a later project stage it is also planned to implement direction-dependent routing.
