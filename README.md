# QNEAT

The QNEAT (short for Qgis Network Analysis Tool) Plugin aims to provide sophisticated QGIS Processing-Toolbox algorithms
in the Field of Network Analysis. In order to assure usability and consitency in the QGIS software design, the QNEAT-Plugin
is not designed as a simple GUI extension but as a downloadable extension of the toolbox algorithms. Further information will
be provided at the corresponding [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Design-of-advanced-network-analysis-algorithms-for-the-QGIS-processing-library) project-website.

### Currently planned algorithms
- **Shortest Path** (Dijkstra) between coordinates
- **Shortest Path**(Dijkstra) between two points in layers
- **Isochrone Area** calculation with advanced interpolation techniques
- **Origin-Destination** Matrix between all points of a layer.

At a later project stage it is also planned to implement direction-dependent routing.

**Please note that the current code in this repository is not yet properly working and containes prototypes that were tested in the QGIS Python console.** 

**Due to the fact that I work full time, updates to the repository may be not that frequently.**
